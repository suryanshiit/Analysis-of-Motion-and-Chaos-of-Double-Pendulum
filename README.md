# Analysis-of-Motion-and-Chaos-of-Double-Pendulum

This MATLAB code simulates the motion of a double pendulum using numerical integration. The simulation spans a time period of 0 to 5 seconds with 50 integration steps. 

The initial conditions are set with initial angles of 0.1 and 0.2 radians for the first and second pendulum, respectively, and initial angular speeds set to zero.

Parameters:

m: Mass of each particle.

l: Length of each pendulum link.

g: Acceleration due to gravity.

Running the Code:

To Implement the code, Run double_pendulum.m on MATLAB. You can also modify the initial conditions as per your wish.

Feel free to explore and modify the parameters to observe different double pendulum behaviors.
